//! The shared vocabulary of the `pith` suite: the one error type, the
//! fixed-width digest value, the Hamming distance between digests, and
//! the closed sets of names that appear in on-disk records. Also the
//! computational primitives every modality crate shares: SHA-256, the
//! checksums (CRC-32, Adler-32, FNV-1a 64), splitmix64 and the bit
//! reader.
//!
//! The foundation crate of the zero-dependency `pith` suite. Every other
//! crate builds on these types and nothing builds beneath them: this
//! crate has an empty `[dependencies]` table, enforced by
//! `scripts/check-zero-deps.py`.
//!
//! The crate is `core`-only: no `std`, no allocator, no filesystem,
//! network, clock or environment. Nothing here makes a result depend on
//! anything but its arguments, and no code path allocates.
